Laser Pointer Detection using OpenCV
This project is a Python application designed to detect laser pointers using a webcam. The application leverages OpenCV to identify laser pointers up to 2 meters away, allowing for a tolerance of 10 cm. It demonstrates fundamental computer vision concepts, including color detection and contour analysis.

Features
Real-Time Detection: Utilizes a webcam to process video frames in real time.
Multicolor Detection: Capable of detecting red, green, and blue laser pointers.
Contour Analysis: Implements contour detection to identify and track the brightest point matching the laser pointer.
Adjustable Parameters: Easily modify HSV color ranges to calibrate detection settings for different lighting conditions or laser colors.
Setup and Installation
To run this project, you'll need Python installed on your machine as well as the necessary libraries. Follow the steps below to get started:

Install Python (if not already installed):

Download and install Python from python.org.
Install Required Libraries:

git clone <repository-link>
Alternatively, download the ZIP of the repository and extract it.
Run the Application:

Navigate to the directory containing the code.
Use the command below to execute the script:
bash
复制代码
python laser_pointer_detection.py
How It Works
Capture Frames: Continuously capture frames from the webcam feed.
Convert to HSV: Convert each frame from BGR to HSV color space to facilitate color detection.
Create Masks: Define HSV color ranges for red, green, and blue and generate masks to isolate these colors.
Contour Detection: Apply contour detection to identify potential laser pointer locations.
Enclosing Circle: For each detected contour, compute the minimum enclosing circle to determine the size and location of the laser pointer.
Display Results: Annotate the frame with circles and coordinates, displaying real-time detection results in a window.
Usage Notes
Adjust HSV Ranges: Depending on the environment and laser pointer type, you may need to adjust HSV values for better performance.
Distance and Lighting: Laser pointer detection accuracy may vary with distance and lighting conditions. Experiment with setups for optimal results.
